# Learn with Redwood (*Chakra UI style*)

I am working through Amy Dutton's [Learn with Redwood](https://learnwithredwood.com) course.  It's great, and
I recommend that you sign up and take it with me!

I have provided my own unique twist to the course:  I'm using [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com) instead
of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).  Both are efficient tools for UI design.  I simply have more
experience with Chakra, so I decided to stick with it.

This repo contains my work-in-progress course code.
